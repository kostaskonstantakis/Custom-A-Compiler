Project for CS340 Compilers, UOC 2021 

Custom implementation of a programming language, which we called Alpha, as well as its virtual machine. 
It has some object-oriented, as well as some functional, and dynamic programming language traits. 
Some simple user functions are supported, but not recursive ones. 
Arrays(called tables in our language terminology) aren't supported, either! 

The following are the library functions: 
 print
 input
 objectmemberkeys
 objecttotalmembers
 objectcopy
 totalarguments
 argument
 typeof
 strtonum
 sqrt
 cos
 sin
